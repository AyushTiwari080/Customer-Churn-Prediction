# Predictive-Analysis-for-Customer-Retention

A machine learning project that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on demographic, account, and service-usage data.

## ⭐ Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based businesses. Losing customers not only impacts revenue but also increases the cost of acquiring new ones. This project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their demographics, account information, and service usage patterns.

By analyzing historical churn data, the model identifies patterns and signals that indicate a high risk of churn. Businesses can use these insights to take proactive actions such as offering personalized promotions, improving customer support, or tailoring services to increase retention.

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. The end goal is to create a reliable prediction pipeline that helps companies make data-driven decisions to improve customer loyalty and reduce churn.

I can also create a **more visually appealing version** with badges, GIFs, and a cleaner layout for GitHub if you want it to stand out.  

Do you want me to do that next?
